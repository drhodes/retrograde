for each of these exercises, enter the directory and use

$ cargo test

NOTE: cargo test can be run in the src directory also.

to get an idea of what might be wrong, then edit the file indicated by
the exercise directory name. For example,

The directory: exercise-1-suit, requires modification of src/suit.rs
                          ^^^^                               ^^^^

That is the only file that needs to be modified, Search for TODO
within the file and do what it suggests. When the tests run without
failing and there are no errors the exercise is complete.
